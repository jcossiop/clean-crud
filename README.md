# Clean Crud 

Clean CRUD exercise

---

## Purpose

The idea with this execise is to create a simple application that follows **Clean Architecture** principles and **TDD** methodologies.

## Use Cases

1. As a practice user I want to be able to sign in the application in order to have access to restricted actions on it.
2. As an authenticated practice user, I want to be able to manage Representative information, so that I can register, edit, list and remove all the reps that interact with us, and have the information readily available to consult for our day to day operation.
